/**
 * @name ReliableEndpoint
 * @description Reliable Endpoint owns a transport handle to communicate and
 *              exchange data with its remote peer. According to the design of
 *              the connection- based application, the Reliable Endpoint can be
 *              a Service Handler, or even a middleware underneath the Service
 *              Handler. This component stores the data (e.g., bytes) sent into
 *              a buffer to be able to retransmit it when lost due to crashes. 
 *              To reestablish a failed connection and retransmit the data that
 *              has been lost due to connection crashes, the Reliable Endpoint
 *              needs to implement some extra actions that are defined and
 *              encapsulated in a new component, named Connection Handler.
